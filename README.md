# VIVO CTSI Pilot Award Report

Produce a report from VIVO of the papers and grants
of each pilot awardee following their pilot award.

The report is organized by RFA and lists each pilot award
by name, it's principal investigator, followed by the
papers and funding that followed the award.

The report is produced as RTF (Rich Text Format), ready to
be edited in Word.  This allows for minor touch-ups, if
desired, for high-stakes reporting.

The software here relies on rtf-ng, a Python library for
producing RTF.
